First-Person Dungeon Crawler inspired by Might and Magic IV, Diablo II, the Dark Souls series, and Legend of Grimrock

I worked on this project with 1 other person that I took several classes with at the Academy of Art University

Features I worked on: architecture, save/load system, random dungeon and loot generation, inventory
and equipment, combat, spells, UI, and AI
