First-Person Dungeon Crawler inspired by Might and Magic IV, Diablo II, the Dark Souls series, and Legend of Grimrock

I worked on this project with 1 other person that I took several classes with at the Academy of Art University

Features created entirely by me:
Procedurally generated dungeon
Spell system
UI

The zip is too large so I have to link it through Google drive
